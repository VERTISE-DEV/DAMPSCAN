 * The morning digest: one push per business that has something to say.

 * and what happened since the last digest. Counts and amounts only. The rows
 * it summarises are stamped so the next morning starts where this one left
 * off, and a business with nothing to report gets no push at all, because a
 * daily "nothing" teaches a phone to ignore the topic.
