/**
 * What happened to a lead's notification email, in words staff can act on.
 *
 * The email is sent by the visitor's browser through FormSubmit, so the only
 * record of it is what that browser managed to report back: confirmed, failed
 * with FormSubmit's or the browser's own message, fired as the page closed and
 * so never confirmed, or nothing at all. The raw messages are browser jargon
 * ("Failed to fetch", "Load failed"), which is why a lead only ever showed
 * "Failed" and nobody could say why. This turns each outcome into a label and
 * a sentence, and keeps the raw text alongside for anyone who wants it.
 *
 * Worked out here rather than in the page so it is tested with everything
 * else, and so the CSV and the table can never disagree.
