 * How the business is doing, for the area being looked at:
 *
 *   money     this month and last: work done, money in, costs; and what is
 *             owed, quoted and booked right now. Manage or admin only, as on
 *             the Due list.
 *   months    the last twelve: enquiries, jobs won, work done, money in
 *   funnel    the last ninety days: enquiries, jobs started from them, won,
 *             lost, the win rate and the average job
 *   channels  where the last year's enquiries came from, and how many won
 *   places    the postcode districts they came from, which is what says
 *             which area pages are earning and which towns to write next
 *   pagesToWrite the districts in `places` with no area page of their own
 *             yet on that brand's site, busiest first: the area pages to
 *             write next (compared with lib/generated, which the build writes
 *             from content/areas)
 *   issues    what people asked about
 *   ratings   the customers' stars from the "how did we do" page: the
 *             average, how many, and the low ones with what they said
 *   overBudget quoted-trade jobs whose costs and clocked labour have passed
 *             the set share of the price (lib/profit.js). Money, so manage only
 *   search    Google Search Console, per brand: appearances, clicks,
 *             position, and the searches and pages behind them, once a
 *             service account is set up (lib/search-console.js)
 *
 * A job's value is its invoice for the quoted trades and the survey plus any
 * remedial work for damp, which is how each business prices. Money in is the
 * payments ledger for the quoted trades, and for damp the full price on the
 * day it was marked paid, which is the only date the damp jobs keep.
